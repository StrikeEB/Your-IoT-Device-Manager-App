## Introduction to Application


Your IoT Device Manager Application is aimed to help organisations track their IoT Devices effectively. The end product of the App would help to log information about devices, location, pictures of the installation in a structured way and upload that to an online database (Firestore). This database would act as the master list for all devices and then by interacting with devices' outputs, it would enable big data analysis.
